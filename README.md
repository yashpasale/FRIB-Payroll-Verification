# Payroll Verfication Software for FRIB Accounting Team

# Built in python using Tkinter for FRIB Accounting.

Released beta version for Payroll verification. This software is an executable (.exe) file to run locally on user's computer.

This is the complete working version for Payroll verification and will allow accounting team to convert incoming .txt files to an excel spread sheet.

Pandas plays a role where data is organized into a dataframe and cleans the discrepancies in the converted excel file which can be observed after the Text (.txt) file converts to Excel (.xlsx) . These discrepancies can change overtime, so more bugfixes can be seen in this particular area in the future.
